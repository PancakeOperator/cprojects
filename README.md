this is supposed to be a user login program
where the user enters a correct username and password get in
but if the username and password are not correct within 3 or above 3 try's it kicks them out
and it works (mostly) the user can enter a name and a password
the user can retry it again if the correct info has been given
however it does not do it correctly

after the first two attempts are made it goes back to the first attempt
i assume something with the counter has gone haywire
i have tried a goto style and it still did not work

when entering a large digit as the pasword it seems to change how many attempts were made 
and entering [NULL] on both gave it a huge number
i think im going to give up on this for a little while
